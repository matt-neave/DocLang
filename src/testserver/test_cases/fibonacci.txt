// Fibonacci program written in DocLang

shell_fib number (number n).
    tony says if n is upper bounded by 1 then.
        ret is obviously n.
    panopto says.
        ssh shell_fibAcc@ret n 1 0.
    okie dokie.

    OH BABY! ret.

shell_fibAcc number (number n, number prev, number acc).
    kon says if n is upper bounded by 0 then.
        return is obviously acc.
    panopto says.
        n is obviously n minus 1.
        newAcc is obviously prev plus acc.

        ssh shell_fibAcc@return n acc newAcc.

    okie dokie.

    OH BABY! return.

start is obviously 10.
ssh shell_fib@answer start.
